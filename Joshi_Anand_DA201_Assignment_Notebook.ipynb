      "attended by the patient (or not), or has been cancelled. This status changes over \n",
      "time, for example when a patient makes a booking, the appointment status changes \n",
      "from â€˜Availableâ€™ to â€˜Bookedâ€™. This release reports the final status of each \n",

      "In most cases, at the time of the appointment a â€˜Bookedâ€™ status will be changed to \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Appointment mode (appointment_mode)\n",
      "The mode of the appointment shows the setting of the consultation. For example, face to face, \n",
      "telephone, or home visits. This is set locally by the practices so it may not represent the actual \n",

      "\n",
      "Some home visits and telephone triage sessions are booked in to early-morning sessions \n",
      "(6 am to 6:20 am) for each GP as untimed appointments, but the consultations happen in the \n",
      "afternoon. They are booked in to early-morning sessions so that they appear on the top of the \n",
      "appointment book screen for each GP. At some practices, home visits are logged at reception \n",
      "and not in the practice system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless home visits and telephone triage are logged as individual appointments and booked to \n",
      "a patient, they will not appear in this publication. Appointments marked as online, video or \n",
      "video conference are shown as 'Online / Video'. This may or may not include a video element. \n",
      "Non-video based online consultations such as live chat or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) \n",
      "and video-based appointments are all included in this category.\n",
      "\n",

      "the proportion of appointments with an 'Unknown' appointment mode is higher in releases from \n",
      "July 2019 onwards when Cegedim practices were included in the publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Actual duration (actual_duration)\n",
      "Actual duration data was first included in the April 2022 release with data from \n",
      "December 2021. Actual duration is the length in minutes of the consultation that\n",
      "took place.\n",
      "\n",
      "This field is recorded differently depending on the practiceâ€™s system supplier. \n",
      "For example, EMIS records the actual duration as the time between the patient being \n",
      "called into their appointment and the time the clinician records that the consultation \n",
      "is complete. TPP can record the start time as either when the consultation is started, \n",
      "when a clinician calls for a patient, or when the appointment status is changed to \n",
      "â€˜in progressâ€™. The end time is recorded as when the appointment is marked as finished \n",
      "with the actual duration being the difference between these two times. This leads to \n",
      "variations in data quality that NHS Digital is continuing to work with system suppliers \n",
      "to address.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any appointments with a null duration or a duration of less than one minute or greater \n",
      "than 60 minutes have been grouped into an â€˜Unknown / Data Quality Issueâ€™ category within \n",
      "this publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Context type (context_type)\n",
      "The National Categories are subdivided into three â€˜Context Typesâ€™. The context describes \n",
      "whether an appointment is an encounter relating to direct patient care, or an activity \n",
      "undertaken as part of patient care where the patient is not involved. Where category data \n",
      "is not received, an appointment is assigned to an â€˜Unmappedâ€™ context type.\n",

      "\n",
      "6) National categories (national_category)\n",
      "Within each context type, there is an option for practices to choose a â€˜Does Not Fitâ€™ category. \n",
      "This is used only when a practice is unable to place an appointment type within one of the \n",
      "predefined categories. These appointments are assigned to the â€˜Inconsistent Mappingâ€™ context \n",
